Survival analysis is a fairly niche area of statistics that I learned about specifically for this project. In this post, I introduce both the models and the R code we used to fit the them.  

## Time-to-event data

## Cox survival model

The [Cox model]() is a powerful tool for analyzing time-to-event data. It can be broken into two components: 

1. A flexible non-parametric model for the underlying hazard function, h_0
2. A multiplicative model for the effects of features on the hazard function for an individual h_i

Mathematically, the model for the hazard function looks like this:

Where h_0 is the non-parametric baseline hazard function. You can see that if all the regression coefficients are equal to 1, then h_i = h_0. The linear model component  

Since the Cox model is a combination of non-parametric and parametric components, it is often called 'semi-parametric'. 



particularly if you have a lot of *censored data*. Censored data occurs when you know either the start or end time for an individual's time line, but not both. For example, if a patient enrolled in a study drops out before the trial is complete, you may have data on when they started a treatment but no information after they dropped out.

I am a Data Scientist on the marketing team at [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/) and an analytics lecturer at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/analytics/). Before KAYAK, I earned my PhD in Biological Anthropology from Duke University, where I studied the ecology and evolution of primates.

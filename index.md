<p><h1>About me</h1></p>

___

I am a Data Scientist on the marketing team at [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/). In addition, I love teaching and serve as a part-time analytics lecturer at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/analytics/).

Before KAYAK, I earned my PhD in Biological Anthropology from Duke University, where I studied the ecology and evolution of primates. An Insight Data Science Fellowship helped me make the jump to industry.
